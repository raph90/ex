# Personal React Boilerplate

This is a React boilerplate entirely set up by hand, with Webpack. 
There is no 
- CRA
- any other build stuff

The aim is to be able to plug and play with dependencies, but for a basic starter I'll be using 
Ant Design with Less CSS. 

## Note!

This repo is designed to be used with node 16.13.1
